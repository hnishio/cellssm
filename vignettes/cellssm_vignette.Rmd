## Overview
An easy way for molecular biologists to analyse the time series of distances of cells or organelles from an external stimulus. Using this package, one can estimate the true dynamics from noisy movement data, extract the common dynamics among multiple cells or organelles, and estimate the start time of the movements.


## Details
The package only requires the preparation of csv files containing the columns time (min, sec, etc.), presence of stimulus (0 or 1), and distance of cells from the stimulus (millimeter, micrometer, etc.). The main functions are based on the Bayesian inference of the parameters in the state-space model, including the time-varying coefficient of regression. This package consists of main functions to implement state-space modelling, and sub-functions to perform
minor tasks.


#### Main functions:
* ssm_individual : Bayesian inference of the state-space model for individual dynamics
* ssm_common : Bayesian inference of the state-space model to extract common dynamics
* ssm_KFAS : Inference of the state-space model for individual dynamics using Kalman filter
* nomodel : Estimation of movement without the state-space model


## Installation
You can install the development version of cellssm from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hnishio/cellssm")
```


## Model definition of the state-space model (individual model)
We assumed that the distances of the target cells or organelles from the explanatory variable (light, heat, etc.) was broken down into their random walk and the effect of the explanatory variable. The explanatory variable was supposed to affect the velocity of the targets, which changed the location as a result. The state-space model to analyse the time-varying effect of the explanatory variable on the velocity of movement was defined by the equations:

\begin{align}
  w[t] & \sim \text{Normal}(0,\sigma^{2}_w), \\

  ex[t] & =
  \begin{cases}
  0 & (t_{start} \leq t \leq t_{on}-1)\\
  1 & (t_{on} \leq t \leq t_{off})\\
  0 & (t_{off}+1 \leq t \leq t_{end})
  \end{cases}, \\

  \beta_{ex}[t] & \sim
  \begin{cases}
  NULL & (t_{start} \leq t \leq t_{on}-1)\\
  \text{Normal}(0,\sigma^{2}_{\beta{ex}}) & (t = t_{on})\\
  \text{Normal}(\beta_{ex}[t-1],\sigma^{2}_{\beta{ex}}) & (t_{on}+1 \leq t \leq t_{off})\\
  NULL & (t_{off}+1 \leq t \leq t_{end})
  \end{cases}, \\

  \alpha[t] & =
  \begin{cases}
  w[t] & (t_{start} \leq t \leq t_{on}-1)\\
  w[t] + \beta_{ex}[t] \cdot ex[t] & (t_{on} \leq t \leq t_{off})\\
  w[t] & (t_{off}+1 \leq t \leq t_{end})
  \end{cases}, \\

  y[t] & \sim \text{Normal}(\alpha[t],\sigma^{2}_y),
\end{align}

where *w*[*t*] is the white noise at the time *t*, *ex*[*t*] is the absence and presence of the explanatory variable at the time *t* represented by 0 and 1, respectively, $\beta$<sub>*ex*</sub>[*t*] is the time-varying regression coefficient of an explanatory variable at the time *t*, $\alpha$[*t*] is the true state of velocity of movement at the time *t*, *y*[t] is the observed velocity of movement at the time *t*, and $\sigma$<sup>2</sup> is the variance. *t*<sub>*start*</sub>, *t*<sub>*on*</sub>, *t*<sub>*off*</sub> and *t*<sub>*end*</sub> are time at the start of the time-course, the start of the explanatory variable, the end of the explanatory variable and the end of the time-course. *t* = (*t*<sub>*start*</sub>, ⋯ , *t*<sub>*on*</sub>, ⋯, *t*<sub>*off*</sub>, ⋯, *t*<sub>*end*</sub>) is the time point at one unit interval.


## Model definition of the state-space model (common model)
In this model, we assumed an imaginary chloroplast which had a distance from the microbeam of zero, and dynamics referred to as the “common dynamics” for each cell. The state-space representation of the common dynamics is similar to that of the “individual model” explained in the previous section. We then assumed that the real dynamics of all chloroplasts followed the common dynamics after the start time estimated for each chloroplast by the “individual model”. The state-space representation of the “common model” is defined by the equations:

\begin{align}
  w[t] & \sim \text{Normal}(0,\sigma^{2}_w), \\

  ex[t] & =
  \begin{cases}
  0 & (t_{start} \leq t \leq t_{on}-1)\\
  1 & (t_{on} \leq t \leq t_{off})\\
  0 & (t_{off}+1 \leq t \leq t_{end})
  \end{cases}, \\

  \beta_{ex, common}[t] & \sim
  \begin{cases}
  NULL & (t_{start} \leq t \leq t_{on}-1)\\
  \text{Normal}(0,\sigma^{2}_{\beta{ex}}) & (t = t_{on})\\
  \text{Normal}(\beta_{ex, common}[t-1],\sigma^{2}_{\beta{ex}}) & (t_{on}+1 \leq t \leq t_{off})\\
  NULL & (t_{off}+1 \leq t \leq t_{end})
  \end{cases}, \\

  \beta_{ex, each}[t, n] & \sim
  \begin{cases}
  NULL & (t_{start} \leq t \leq t_{on}-1)\\
  0 & (t_{on} \leq t \leq (t_{on}-3 + start[n]))\\
  \beta_{ex, common}[t-start[n]+2] & ((t_{on}-2+start[n]) \leq t \leq t_{off})\\
  NULL & (t_{off}+1 \leq t \leq t_{end})
  \end{cases}, \\

  \alpha_{common}[t] & =
  \begin{cases}
  w[t] & (t_{start} \leq t \leq t_{on}-1)\\
  w[t] + \beta_{ex, common}[t] \cdot ex[t] & (t_{on} \leq t \leq t_{off})\\
  w[t] & (t_{off}+1 \leq t \leq t_{end})
  \end{cases}, \\

  \alpha_{each}[t, n] & =
  \begin{cases}
  w[t] & (t_{start} \leq t \leq t_{on}-1)\\
  w[t] + \beta_{ex, each}[t, n] \cdot ex[t] & (t_{on} \leq t \leq t_{off})\\
  w[t] & (t_{off}+1 \leq t \leq t_{end})
  \end{cases}, \\

  y[t, n] & \sim \text{Normal}(\alpha_{each}[t, n],\sigma^{2}_y), \\

  dist_{common}[t] & = \sum_{i=1}^t \alpha_{common}[i] - \sum_{i=1}^{t_{on}-1} \alpha_{common}[i],
\end{align}

where *w*[*t*] is the white noise at time *t*; *ex*[*t*] is the absence and presence of the explanatory variable at time *t* represented by 0 and 1, respectively; $\beta$<sub>*ex, common*</sub>[*t*] is the common time-varying regression coefficient of the explanatory variable at time *t*; $\beta$<sub>*ex, each*</sub>[*t, n*] is the time-varying regression coefficient of the explanatory variable at time *t* in the response variable *n*; $\alpha$<sub>*common*</sub>[*t*] is the common velocity of movement at time *t*;  $\alpha$<sub>*each*</sub>[*t, n*] is the estimated velocity of movement at time *t* in the response variable *n*; *y*[*t, n*] is the observed velocity of movement at time *t* in the response variable *n*; *dist*<sub>*common*</sub>[*t*] is the distance of the response variable from the explanatory variable at time *t*; and $\sigma$<sup>2</sup> is the variance. *t*<sub>*start*</sub>, *t*<sub>*on*</sub>, *t*<sub>*off*</sub>, and *t*<sub>*end*</sub> are time at the start of the time-course, the start of the explanatory variable, the end of the explanatory variable, and the end of the time-course. *t* = (*t*<sub>*start*</sub>, ⋯ , *t*<sub>*on*</sub>, ⋯, *t*<sub>*off*</sub>, ⋯, *t*<sub>*end*</sub>) is the time point at one unit interval.



## Workflow example (chloroplast accumulation responses to a blue microbeam)



#### Bayesian inference of the state-space model (individual model)
```{r ssm_individual setup}
# Load package
library(cellssm)
# Load data of chloroplast movements
data("cell1", "cell2", "cell3", "cell4")
cell_list <- list(cell1, cell2, cell3, cell4)
# Check the format of the input data
cell_list[[1]][1:5, 1:5]
cell_list[[1]][116:120, 1:5]
```

```{r ssm_individual, eval = F}
# Set the path where CmdStan was installed
cmdstanr::set_cmdstan_path("~/cmdstan/")
# Execution of state-space modelling
ssm_individual(cell_list = cell_list, out = "02_ssm_individual",
               res_name = "chloroplast", ex_name = "microbeam",
               unit1 = "micrometer", unit2 = "min")
```

This figure is an example of the output files: Bayesian inference of the state-space model for a chloroplast in cell 1. The observed distance of the chloroplast from the blue microbeam (first panel), the observed and inferred velocity of movement (second panel), the inferred coefficient of the blue microbeam (third panel), and the inferred random fluctuations of the velocity (last panel) are shown. Dots, solid lines, and shaded regions are the observed values, medians, and 95 % credible intervals of the Bayesian inference, respectively. Orange solid lines represent the start time estimated by the model. The shaded and light regions represent the period without and with the explanatory variable (a blue microbeam), respectively.

#### Robust linear regression (x: distance at time 0, y: coefficient of explanatory variable or velocity)

To test if the velocity of chloroplast movement during transport depends on the distance from the blue microbeam at the start of irradiation, repeated median regression can be performed.

```{r lm_dist_beta setup}
# Load data
data("chloroplast_mvtime")
# Check the format of the input data
chloroplast_mvtime[1:5,]
```

```{r lm_dist_beta, eval = F}
# Specify the path of the output directory of [ssm_individual] or [ssm_KFAS]
# Below, the path of the system files is specified to provide an example
ssm_file <- stringr::str_split(system.file("extdata", "individual_model.stan",
                                           package = "cellssm"), "/")[[1]]
ssm_path <- paste(ssm_file[-length(ssm_file)], collapse = "/")
# Linear regression
glist <- lm_dist_beta(cell_list = cell_list, mvtime = chloroplast_mvtime,
                      ssm_path = ssm_path,
                      ssm_method = "Bayes", res_name = "chloroplast",
                      ex_name = "microbeam", unit1 = "micrometer", unit2 = "min")
(glist[[1]] + labs(tag = "A")) + (glist[[2]] + labs(tag = "B")) + (glist[[3]] + labs(tag = "C")) + 
  (glist[[4]] + labs(tag = "D")) + (glist[[5]] + labs(tag = "E")) +
  patchwork::plot_layout(nrow = 2)
```

![](../man/figures/individual_chloroplast_lm_dist_beta.jpg){width=100%}

**A**–**E** Repeated median regression of the mean coefficient of microbeam during the time course (**A**), the most negative coefficient of microbeam (**B**), the standard deviation of coefficient of microbeam (**C**), the mean velocity of movement (**D**), and the most negative velocity of movement (**E**), against the distances of chloroplasts from the blue microbeam at the start of irradiation. In **A**–**E**, dots, solid lines and shaded regions are the observed values, regression lines and 95% confidence intervals, respectively.


#### Estimation of the signal transfer speed by linear regression (x: start time, y: distance at time 0)

```{r lm_signal, eval = F}
# Linear regression
glist <- lm_signal(cell_list = cell_list, mvtime = chloroplast_mvtime,
                   ex_name = "microbeam", unit1 = "micrometer", unit2 = "min")
glist[[1]] + glist[[2]] + glist[[3]] + glist[[4]] + glist[[5]] + glist[[6]] +
   patchwork::plot_layout(ncol = 3)
```

![](../man/figures/individual_chloroplast_lm_signal.jpg){width=100%}

Linear regression of the distance of chloroplast from a blue microbeam, against the start time estimated by the Bayesian inference. The speed of signal transfer was defined as the slope of regression lines. Dots, solid lines and shaded regions are the observed values, regression lines and 95% confidence intervals, respectively. 

#### Bayesian inference of the state-space model (common model)
```{r setup2}
# Load data of chloroplast movements
data("cell1", "cell2", "cell3", "cell4", "chloroplast_mvtime")
cell_list <- list(cell1, cell2, cell3, cell4)
```

```{r ssm_common, eval = F}
# Set the path where CmdStan was installed
cmdstanr::set_cmdstan_path("~/cmdstan/")
# Execution of state-space modelling
# With the data frame of the movement time. This is recommended.
ssm_common(cell_list = cell_list, mvtime = chloroplast_mvtime, out = "08_ssm_common",
          res_name = "chloroplast", ex_name = "microbeam",
          unit1 = "micrometer", unit2 = "min")
```

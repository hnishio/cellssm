# cellssm

## Overview

cellssm provides an easy way to analyze the time-series of distances of cells or organelles from an external stimulus. Main functions are based on the Bayesian inference of parameters in the state-space model.

## Installation

You can install the development version of cellssm from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hnishio/cellssm")
```

## Example

A real data example of chloroplast accumulation responses to a blue microbeam:

```{r setting, include=F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = F, message = F)
```

```{r example}
# Load packages
library(cellssm)

# Set the path to which CmdStan was installed
cmdstanr::set_cmdstan_path("~/cmdstan/")

# Load data of chloroplast movements
data("cell1", "cell2", "cell3", "cell4")
cell_list <- list(cell1[,1:3])
# This is for a chloroplast in a cell as an example.
# If you want to run the modeling for multiple data frames, execute:
# cell_list <- list(cell1, cell2, cell3, cell4)

# Execution of state-space modeling
ssm_individual(cell_list = cell_list, out = "02_ssm_individual",
               res_name = "chloroplast", ex_name = "microbeam",
               unit1 = "micrometer", unit2 = "min")

```

This figure is an example of the output files. Dots, solid lines and shaded regions are the observed values, median and 95% credible intervals of the Bayesian inference, respectively. Orange solid lines represent the start time estimated by the model. Shaded and light regions represent the period without and with the explanatory variable, respectively.
